# event emitter
A Python source-to-image application for emitting to an Apache Kafka topic

## Launching on OpenShift

```
oc new-app python:3.8~https://github.com/kamorisan/event-emitter -e KAFKA_BROKERS=my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.my-kafka.svc:9092 -e KAFKA_TOPIC=my-topic -e RATE=1 --name=emitter
```

You will need to adjust the `KAFKA_BROKERS` and `KAFKA_TOPICS` variables to
match your configured Kafka deployment and desired topic. The `RATE` variable
controls how many messages per second the emitter will send, by default this
is set to 3.
